## About
<div id="about"></div>
This project is one of the most free projects of the first year. Create our own RPG.

The main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything we know.

Our game must follow the following rules:

- The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.
- The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.
- There must be NPC in your game.
- You need to implement at least one quest.
- The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.
- The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.
- With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.

To give users the feeling that we are delivering a complete product, we need to polish our game as much as possible.

- Having a pleasant user interface.
- Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . .)
- Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
- Create a game with a beginning and an end.
